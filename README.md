# Mock API Server

A simple PHP-based mock API server which can be setup quickly for testing and development purposes.

This is just a server that accepts HTTP requests, and responds based on pre-defined data in `api.json`file, there is no security, no validation, so don't use it on PROD!

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Put the file to your local server or web server

3. Customize `api.json` file to define your routes and response.

4. Send HTTP requests to test
